      <h1>On passion, ambition, and regret</h1>
      <h2 id="of-passion">Of passion</h2>

<p>It is the fulfillment (the joy) of justifying your being through meaningful actions, places, people, et cetera. These actions are meaningful because they justify your being; they justify the suffering of your life. When we act upon meaningful things, our being becomes justified. We bear the suffering, we even find contentedness with it, and some happiness from that. To be passionate is to act upon meaningful things, and it is passion that drives us to continue to find meaningful things. Find passionate things by limiting your mind and listening within yourself, to your moral intuition. You must be virtuous, however, for your intuition to guide you; else, you disconnect your being and intuition, and cannot justify your being. So, be virtuous and listen to your intuition and you will find passion from what it serves.</p>

<h2 id="of-ambition">Of ambition</h2>

<p>It is the desire to act on things that are meaningful in our lives; ambition is a call from our moral intuition to our mind saying that this thing justifies our being. “Ambition … is the most primal and sacred of the fundament of our being. To feel ambition and to act upon it is to embrace the unique calling of our souls. Not to act upon that ambition is to turn your backs on ourselves and on the reason for our existence” (1). To ignore ambition is to ignore the call from our intuition, and by doing so, we are ignoring things that are meaningful to us. By ignoring ambition, we are unable to bear the suffering of our lives. So, always act on your ambition. Be virtuous in your action. Act on ambition by clearing your mind and allowing your intuition to guide your actions.</p>

<h2 id="of-regret">Of regret</h2>

<p>It is being upset with ourselves for our actions that went against our moral intuition and as such, unjustified our being. We intuitively know the difference between good and evil, and when we do actions that we know are wrong, we regret those actions. Why? Because those actions did not justify our being; they possessed no meaning to us and were unvirtuous. To commit unvirtuous actions is to damage your moral intuition, and when your intuition is hurt, you regret, because your being cannot connect to your intuition, and you cannot justify your being. How do we deal with regret? First, by being virtuous. When we are virtuous, the connection is strong and our intuition is healthy. Second, when we do commit unvirtuous acts, we should stop and recognize our mistakes. Clear your mind and ask yourself of the regret, “why did I do that? What is unvirtuous about it? What do I need to do to learn from this mistake?” and listen to your intuition. It will serve you with the answers that you need so that you can repair the damage.</p>
